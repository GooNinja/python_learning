##     I practice .py here

I learn .py via

## Python Leraning Git Repositories~@Asabeneh's
https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python 

## Youtube Tutorials ~ Brocode python playlist
https://youtu.be/6VElWbND-zg?si=CMEldYmZ1En30r2a

I would recommend those for absolute beginners.

## My learning technique
I do four Bro Code videos a day and complete two days' worth of tasks from the 30 Days repo each day. 
This way, I will complete the repo in 15 days while still doing Bro Code. 
I'm hoping to finish the BroCode python tutorial in one month though.
I'll add what's next............
