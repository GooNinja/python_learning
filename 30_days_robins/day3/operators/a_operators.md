# Understanding Operators
Operators are special symbols that perform specific operations on one or more values (operands). Python supports a wide range of operators for various purposes.

## Basic Operators
### Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| + | Addition | `x + y` |
| - | Subtraction | `x - y` |
| * | Multiplication | `x * y` |
| / | Division | `x / y` |
| % | Modulus (remainder) | `x % y` |
| // | Floor division (quotient without remainder) | `x // y` |
| ** | Exponentiation | `x ** y` |

### Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| == | Equal to | `x == y` |
| != | Not equal to | `x != y` |
| > | Greater than | `x > y` |
| < | Less than | `x < y` |
| >= | Greater than or equal to | `x >= y` |
| <= | Less than or equal to | `x <= y` |

### Logical Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| and | Returns True if both operands are True | `x and y` |
| or | Returns True if at least one operand is True | `x or y` |
| not | Reverses the result of the operand | `not x` |

### Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Equivalent to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| = | `x = 5` | `x = 5` |
| += | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3` |
| -= | `x -= 3` | `x = x - 3` |
| *= | `x *= 3` | `x = x * 3` |
| /= | `x /= 3` | `x = x / 3` |
| %= | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3` |
| //= | `x //= 3` | `x = x // 3` |
| **= | `x **= 3` | `x = x ** 3` |

### Membership Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| in | Returns True if a value is present in a sequence | `x in y` |
| not in | Returns True if a value is not present in a sequence | `x not in y` |

### Identity Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is | Returns True if both variables refer to the same object | `x is y` |
| is not | Returns True if both variables do not refer to the same object | `x is not y` |

### Bitwise Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| & | Bitwise AND | `x & y` |
| ^ | Bitwise XOR | `x ^ y` |
| ~ | Bitwise NOT | `~x` |
| << | Left shift | `x << y` |
| >> | Right shift | `x >> y` |

### Advanced Concepts

* **Operator Overloading**: Defining custom behavior for operators on user-defined objects.
* **Operator Precedence**: Understanding the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
* **Operator Associativity**: Determining the grouping of operands when multiple operators of the same precedence are present.
* **Bitwise Operators in Depth**: Exploring advanced bitwise operations and their applications.
