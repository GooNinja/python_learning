# Accessing Characters in Strings by Index
# In programming counting starts from zero.
# Therefore the first letter of a string is at zero index
# and the last letter of a string is the length of a string minus one.
# String index

language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
